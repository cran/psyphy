v0.0-6
 - added an mafc link for the cloglog link, which permits fitting Weibull
 psychometric functions on a log stimulus axis.  See example(mafc).
v0.0-7
 - added mafc.weib link that is just an alias for mafc.cloglog
 - added mafc.cauchit link
v0.0-8
 - added additional links that include parameters for both upper and lower  
 asymptotes and a function, psyfun.2asym, that is a wrapper for glm and 
 uses the new links to fit a psychometric function with variable lower and 
 upper asymptotes.
v0.0-9
 - added standard error estimates based on the Hessian from last iteration 
 of optim to the output of psyfun.2asym (suggested by Ralph Pirow).
v0.1-0
 - second graphic of mafc example set to aspect = "xy" for better 
 rendition
 - modified column names of data set ecc2 from nyes, nno to 
 Correct and Incorrect, better reflecting the meaning of these
 variables.
v0.1-1
 - fixed an unmatched parenthesis in summary.lambda.Rd
 - fixed a double dot '..' in the name of an Rd file that did not belong
v0.1-2
 - fixed some warnings for Rd files
v0.1-3
  - dprime.SD was failing for small values of H and FA when equal
    (thanks to Paul Willis) 
 
v0.1-4
  - the argument name of the mafc links (mafc.logit, mafc.probit, etc.)
    has been changed from m to .m.  This should permit these links to
    work with the glmer function in the lme4a, the development version
    of lme4.
  - dealt with some warnings concerning potential partial argument matching

v0.1-5
  - added possibility for dprime.SD to give negative values (with a warning)
    for the IO method (suggested by Sverre Stausland)
  
  - increased the range of possible d' values obtainable from dprime.SD to 10
  (was 5) for method "diff". 

v0.1-6
  - removed LazyLoad from Description

v0.1-7
  - substituted binomial()$linkinv and binomial()$mu.eta for uses of
    .Call in mafc and mafc.logit and logit.2asym link functions. 

v0.1-7
  - eliminated some triple colons from examples

v0.2-0
  - fixed title case per CRAN standards

v0.2-1
  - added ... to initial functions of SS.calib and SS.RGBcalib to accomadate
    passing trace and control arguments for nls as required for R > 4.0.3.

v0.2-3
  - changed URL's to DOI's for JSS citations

v0.3
  - documentation fix in dprime.SD
  - corrected version misalignment in package man page and Description file
